            hey, and i'm not doing the "hi beautiful soul" thing because that's not why you're here 😈✨<br>
            🤍🤍🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i'm not your guru 🤍<br>
            i'm not your saviour 🤍<br>
            and you're not here to be carried 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            you're on your own in the best possible way 😌<br>
            and this right here is my boundary and my magic: bring your own 🧿🔥
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            what i will do is be brutally honest 🤍<br>
            give you the map, decode the framework, and show you how it actually works 🤍<br>
            because it does work 🤍<br>
            and you will get what you're here for 🤍<br>
            just without a complaints box, a refunds desk, or a "you promised me this" storyline 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            you're you 🤍<br>
            with past lives, shame, beliefs, messy stories, wild memories, spicy chapters, butt plug tales 💋<br>
            and all of it belongs 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i don't teach from theory 🤍<br>
            i teach from systems that already exist inside the body, the nervous system, and real life 🤍<br>
            i don't think in ideas or inspiration 😌<br>
            i think in maps, architectures, and frameworks that arrive whole 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i don't brainstorm 🤍<br>
            i don't "work it out on paper" 🤍<br>
            the structure lands first, in-body, and language comes later as translation 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            writing isn't how i find truth 🤍<br>
            it's how i compress it so other people can actually use it 🤍

        <p class="keyholder-text">
            my work lives at the intersection of 🤍<br>
            intelligence 🧠 🤍<br>
            embodiment 🫀 🤍<br>
            money 💸 🤍<br>
            time ⏳ 🤍<br>
            power 👑 🤍<br>
            and ethics 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i'm not interested in spiritual bypassing, hustle culture, or aesthetic enlightenment 🤍 ew 😮‍💨<br>
            i care about systems that hold 🤍<br>
            systems that can support human lives, businesses, families, and communities without collapse 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            if it can't survive contact with real life, i'm not teaching it 🤍

        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i don't belong to a religion, a lineage, an affiliation, or a hierarchy 🤍<br>
            i work for the universe and i always have 🌌 🤍<br>
            i've been a child of it my whole life 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            and i come with the most fucked up trauma and massive business success 🤍<br>
            scandals on scandals 🤍<br>
            nda hook ups 🤍<br>
            spectacular mistakes in business, life, and relationships 🤍<br>
            marriages 🤍 engagements 🤍<br>
            two baby daddies 🤍<br>
            dv os 🤍 court cases 🤍<br>
            addiction 🤍 survival and success arcs 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i won't fuck around with you 🤍<br>
            because i already fucked around enough to find the truth 😌 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i've paid thousands for healing 🤍<br>
            purged more times than i can count 🤍<br>
            tried damn near every modality 🤍<br>
            sat in jungles and circle jerk offs 🤍<br>
            deep sweat lodges 🤍 tantric experiments 🤍<br>
            walked thousands upon thousands of hours of the fucking map myself 🤍<br>
            and yes 🤍 i even licked a toad once 🐸⚡️
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i'm not special 🤍<br>
            i'm not chosen 🤍<br>
            and please don't make me a cult leader 🤍<br>
            there'd be no work and way too many orgasms, absolute chaos 😮‍💨😂 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i'm deeply focused on access over elitism 🤍<br>
            circulation over control 🤍<br>
            infrastructure over personality 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            money, energy, and resources are meant to move 😌 🤍<br>
            not pool around identity, hierarchy, or ego 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            when systems circulate cleanly, people stabilise 🤍<br>
            when people stabilise, change scales 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            that's the work 🤍<br>
            that's the point 🤍<br>
            that's why i'm here 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i'm highly attuned to nervous systems, interference, and signal clarity 🧿 🤍<br>
            high-bandwidth perception needs clean environments, strong boundaries, and ethical containment 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            overstimulation distorts the signal 🤍<br>
            clarity comes from space, embodiment, and restraint 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i don't build systems that depend on me 🤍<br>
            i build systems that can live without me 🤍<br>
            with feedback loops, consent, and coherence baked in 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            because intelligence that only survives in one body always collapses 😌 🤍<br>
            this work isn't about me 🤍<br>
            it's about building structures that last 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i'll always be honest 🤍<br>
            not because it's a brand value 🤍<br>
            but because my nervous system literally won't let me lie 😮‍💨 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            my life has been real 🤍 messy 🤍 lived 🤍<br>
            i didn't arrive here through purity, perfection, or pretending 🤍<br>
            i arrived through trial and error, pain and pleasure, mistakes and miracles, contracts and consequences, grief and growth 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            when you've actually lived your work, there's nothing to hide 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            honesty keeps systems clean 🧿 🤍<br>
            lies distort signal 🤍<br>
            half-truths create interference 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i've seen what happens when people build power on denial, image, or performance 🤍<br>
            it always collapses 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            so i don't do curated truth 🤍<br>
            i do usable truth 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i swear because i'm human 🤍<br>
            because sometimes "that was challenging" is a lie 🤍<br>
            and "that fucked me up for a while" is accurate 😌 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            language carries frequency 🤍<br>
            i won't dilute it to sound palatable or polite 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            i use humour because it regulates the nervous system 😘 🤍<br>
            because laughter creates safety 🤍<br>
            because levity opens perception 🤍<br>
            because taking yourself too seriously is one of the fastest ways to lose clarity 🤍
        </p>
        
        <p class="keyholder-text">
            this work deals with real things 🤍<br>
            money 🤍 power 🤍 desire 🤍 fear 🤍 identity 🤍 responsibility 🤍

        <p class="keyholder-text">
            if i spoke about that like a textbook or a guru, i'd be lying to you 🤍

        <p class="keyholder-text">
            so you'll get truth 🤍<br>
            sometimes soft 🤍<br>
            sometimes sharp 🤍<br>
            sometimes funny 🤍<br>
            sometimes confronting 🤍

            i just have the assigned task of delivering this framework and being its teacher 🤍 that's it 🤍<br>
            this isn't lessons or more learning 🤍 ew 😮‍💨<br>
            this is raw intelligence you won't find anywhere else 🤍
